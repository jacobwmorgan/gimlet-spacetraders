# Gimlet SpaceTraders Client
This is my spacetraders client, space traders is an economic game which I think looks pretty cool.
[Learn more about it here!](https://spacetraders.io/)

This repo is mostly for fun and to expand my python skills.
If I stop updating this its probably because 
1. I got bored
2. Im lazy
3. I completely forgot this existed

## Whats it using?
Im mostly gonna be using the terminal to display whats going on. Mostly using rich, however if this gets changed check the `requirements.txt` for more info.

## How do I use it ??
Install all dependencies 
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Make a new file called `constants.json` and fill it with the correct stuff
```
echo "{ \"API_KEY\":\"\" }" > constants.json
```
run `main.py`

!! This is subject to change !!
